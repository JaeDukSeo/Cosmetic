# Cosmetic Recommendation

 : Mapping cosmetic items based on their ingredients similarities
   I applied the concept of tokenization of NLP and  single vector decomposition to get the similarities of chemical composition of the items and plot the map. 

* cosmetic_1_scraping.py : Web scraping cosmetic data from Sephora with selenium 
* cosmetic_2_ML.py : Cleaning data and tokenizing the ingredients from item descriptions. Visualizing the item map with the dimensional reduction technique. Defining a function for all this previous process and making an interactive bokeh app for a cosmetic recommendation
* cosmetic_map.jupyter : Visualizing the map with bokeh on jupyter notebook
